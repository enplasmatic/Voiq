# Voiq
In my attempt to create a new programming language, I have created Voiq: a language like Python (the language in which I have created Voiq) with a twist.

Quick description of each file and what it does:
**funcs.py**: This has all the functions and the data storage to convert languages.
**input.py**: The input file for the translation from Python to Voiq.
**output.vq**: The output file for the translation from Python to Voiq.
**toVoid.py**: Run this to translate the contents of input.py into Voiq, ending up in output.vq
**main.vq**: An empty file to write Voiq in.
**main.py**: Run this to execute a Voiq file of your choice (given in the input).
